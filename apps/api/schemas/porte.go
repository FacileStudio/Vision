// degrades silently to the email fallback rather than failing.

// porteSchema is porte/pg's Schema with its porte_users table left out and the
// foreign keys repointed at Vision's own users.
//
// porte offers UserStore as the escape hatch for exactly this. This users row
// carries the avatar columns, an upload path and the mailbox ownership every
// account, folder and email hangs off; moving it would be a rewrite of
// everything except authentication. The other three stores come from porte/pg
// unchanged — they only ever touch the tables below.
//
// Kept verbatim from porte otherwise, column for column: pg's queries are
// written against these names, and a divergence here surfaces as a runtime
// error on the login path rather than at boot. That includes the UPDATE below,
// which is porte v0.3.0's re-key: a local identity is now keyed on the account
// id and not on the address. Keeping a copy of porte's schema means the
// migration does not arrive with the version bump — pg.New() never runs
// Schema — so an app that skips this line upgrades to a build where every
// password login answers 401 and nothing logs a reason.

// Vision's api_keys deliberately do NOT move.
//
// Every other app in the suite kept an api_tokens table that was a session
// with a name on it, and folding those into porte_sessions removed a second
// branch from the auth path. Vision's api_keys are not that: they carry a
// site_id, a workspace_id, a scopes column and an is_active flag, so a key is
// a *scoped* credential for the analytics API rather than a stand-in for its
// holder. Moving one into porte_sessions would drop the scope and the site
// binding on the way, turning a read-only key for one site into a full user
// session — a privilege escalation performed by a migration.
//
// They keep their own table and their own authenticator, which the middleware
// still dispatches to on `Bearer vis_…` and `X-API-Key`.

// adoptExistingPasswords moves the argon2 hashes from users.password_hash into
// the identity rows porte/local reads.
//
// Without it the deploy silently ends password login for every existing
// account: the hash is still in the users table, nothing reads it there any
// more, and the login form answers "invalid credentials" to a correct
// password with no error anywhere. The hashes are byte-identical — porte/local
// uses the parameters this app already used — so the move is a copy and nobody
// resets anything.
//
// The subject is the account id, which is what porte.LocalSubject returns and
// what porte/local reads a credential by. It has to move in the same edit as
// the re-key UPDATE above: an INSERT still keyed on lower(btrim(email)) runs
// *after* that migration has swept past it, so it would write a fresh
// address-keyed row that nothing can ever find.
//
// users.password_hash is deliberately left in place. Blanking it in the same
// deploy makes the change unrollbackable for the sake of tidiness, and a
// column nothing reads can be dropped on any later day.

// adoptOIDCSubjects moves the federated identity off the user row and into the

//
// Without it nothing breaks loudly: porte finds no identity for (issuer,
// subject), falls back to matching the verified email, finds the same user and
// links it on the next login. But the email fallback is the weaker path by
// design — it is the one an identity provider that lets a user set any address
// can abuse — and relying on it for every existing account, on the one deploy
// where it would go unnoticed, is not a trade worth making.
//
// The OIDC tokens deliberately do **not** come across. Vision stores them
// encrypted with ENCRYPTION_KEY and porte stores them as it will send them, so
// copying the ciphertext across would hand porte a refresh token that is not
// one: the first profile sync would fail, clear both, and look like the
// provider had revoked them. They are re-issued in full on the user's next SSO
// login, and the only thing missing until then is a background profile
// refresh.
